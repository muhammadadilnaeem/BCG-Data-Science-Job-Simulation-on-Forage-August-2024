Subject: Data Requirements and Proposed Approach for Investigating PowerCo's Churn Issue

Dear Associate Director,

I hope this email finds you well. Following our meeting regarding PowerCo’s challenge with customer churn, Estelle and I have formulated a plan to tackle the issue using our data science methodology. Below, I’ve outlined our approach and the data we’ll need to proceed.

Problem Framing


PowerCo is facing significant customer churn, potentially due to increased competition in the energy market. To address this issue, we will utilize our 5-step data science methodology:

Business Understanding & Problem Framing:

Objective: To determine the key factors influencing customer churn at PowerCo.
Hypothesis: Customers may be leaving due to factors such as price sensitivity, availability of clean energy, customer service experience, and geographic considerations.


Data Collection:

Required Data:
Historical customer data (5+ years) including demographic information, service usage, and churn status.
Pricing plans and changes over the same period.
Customer service interactions and satisfaction scores.
Competitor pricing and service offerings in the same geographic regions.
Data on the type of energy provided (e.g., renewable vs. non-renewable).
Request: We will need PowerCo to provide detailed customer records, pricing histories, customer service logs, and competitor data where possible.


Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning:

Objective: Clean and explore the data to identify patterns and outliers that may influence churn.
Techniques:
Data cleaning: Handle missing values, standardize data formats.
Exploratory analysis: Perform descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualization (e.g., churn rate by price tier, service satisfaction).


Feature Engineering:

Objective: Identify and create features that could better explain churn behavior.
Potential Features:
Price sensitivity index (based on historical pricing and churn data).
Customer loyalty score (based on length of service and satisfaction).
Environmental preference score (based on interest in clean energy options).


Modeling & Evaluation:

Objective: Build and evaluate models to predict customer churn.
Techniques:
Logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict churn likelihood.
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.


Insights & Recommendations:

Objective: Provide actionable insights to PowerCo on how to reduce churn.
Deliverables: A report summarizing the key drivers of churn, potential interventions, and predictive modeling results.


Conclusion


We believe that the combination of these data points and analysis techniques will allow us to uncover the underlying reasons for PowerCo's churn and help in formulating strategies to reduce it.

Please let us know if you require any further details or adjustments to our approach. We look forward to your feedback.
